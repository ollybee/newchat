A small chat app I am writing to learn nodejs and javascript. If your doing the same give me a shout.
If you try this it works best with websockets, so use Chrome.

Currently
uses socket.io to handle connections from clients
Pushes out last 10 messages to client on connection from a redis database
Uses redis pub/sub to push out each keystroke to each user
Allows users to edit old messages by clicking on them, all other clients updated per keystroke

To do
Allow replying to messages by clicking on them, diplay replies indented and stored as seperate thread/cahnnel in Redis
Store timing Deltas in Redis to allow play back of chat
impement login system (node openid)
Refactor code to use more advanced Javascript techniques.
lots more
